# ZoomInUnfold

This unfolding algorithm is to explore delicate structures by unfolding in a natural way. It is more "natural" than existing methods in the sense that it is unfolding step by step with different resolution of microscopes, just like we zooming in to see the details.

Details about this new unfolding method will appear in arXiv.

# Example
An example is provided in main.py. It is a mass distribution of two peaks. The true distribution is shifted and smeared. To run it, just

`python main.py`

and it will do the unfolding and produce plots. I also put the plots in the directory plots/.

# ZoomInUnfold

This unfolding algorithm is to explore delicate structures by unfolding in a natural way. It is more "natural" than existing methods in the sense that it is unfolding step by step with different resolution of microscopes, just like we zooming in to see the details.

Details about this new unfolding method will appear in arXiv.
